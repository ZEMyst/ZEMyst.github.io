                My name is Christopher Johansen Skoglund, and I find interest and enjoyment in UI & UX Design, as well as programming, be it with HTML, CSS, JS or LUAU. (Python hopefully in the future as well.)

            <p>
                I look like the image bellow.

                (Note; If no image is there, or the image is not of me, but instead some game character or something, it is because I havent gotten around to it, or feel uncomfortable with adding a picture of me to this site.)

                Details about me:
            </h2>
            <h6>
                Bellow here will be general information about me, such as some things i struggle with, my challenges, about school and other things. (Prepare for a wall of text)
            </h6>
            <h3>
                School, Certifications, Jobs, Hobbies & Pronouns
            </h3>
            <p>
                For school, I completed years 1-10, moving onto Electrical Engineering for my first year of year 11, completing the whole school year, for then to take a 1 year break from school. During the 1 year break I tried to get a job, at least temporarily, which I did at a gas station for a couple of months. I ended up quitting due to not being treated fairly well by the main staff, and would be spending the rest of that year figuring out what to do the year after, while also practicing LUAU (Programming language) as a hobby.
            </p>
            <p>
                I went to Restaurant and Food Processing for my second time in year 11, where I learned how to cook (to a certain extent). During my year there I ended up not showing up for the final exam, as the whole school year had been rough. I then moved on to IT Service for my first 12th year, where I was hoping to learn more about programming, which I did not, but still completed the year and went on to become an apprentice at a workplace for 2 years. My time as an apprentice lasted the full 2 years, but I never took a certification within IT Service, due to me not believing I had the nessecairy knowledge to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for types of certifications I currently possess.. Its a driving license, and that's it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Previous jobs I have tried out; Working at a gas station, lasted between 2 and 4 months (Can't remember). Worked for 2 years as an apprentice within the county's IT department. Tried out making long hooks for fishing boats for about a month, then moved onto trying some programming for a week, then onto working with small motors, such as lawnmowers, chainsaws and such, and repairing them. I tried out working as a cashier at a grocery store for a few months as well. I then was a part of Gaia Talent (Gaia Vesteralen), which is similar to being a student, learning UI and UX Design during my 10 month stay there.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Hobbies & Free time
            </h3>
            <p>
                My hobbies mainly consist of playing video games, game design (programming & UI Design), Character designing (Not drawing, I commission others for that) and watching Japanese animated shows (Anime). I sometimes go out with friends to play bowling, hang out with them and play board games, for some social interactions. I am quite introverted as a person, so I more often than not, enjoy spending time for myself.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Pronouns
            </h3>
            <p>
                Since I know some people like to know what pronouns to use for someone, I go by anything that you see fit (He/Him She/Her They/Them).

                Interests
            </h3>
            <p>
                I find interest in Game Design and Character Creation, finding joy in making something functional and something that looks appealing to whoever is looking at it. I also have an interest in Japanese animated shows, also known as Anime (My favorite Anime is Frieren: Beyond Journey's End). I also have an interest in playing video games, some video games I play is Genshin Impact, Roblox, Minecraft, Content Warning, Pokemon games, Zelda games and some Mario games.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Likes
            </h3>
            <p>
                I was unsure about how to word anything here, as Its just me telling you what I like. For example; Going to the beach during summer with friends, watching shows, eating food, sleeping, programming, game design, pokemon, things like that, and it will be where I leave it. I personally think that, if you want to actually know these things, you ask me personally.

                <li>
                    <b>Dark open spaces</b> (closed spaces are fine)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>People</b> (I no longer have social anxiety but it still applies to some extent)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Bugs</b> (both actual bugs and game bugs which I have to fix..)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Alcohol</b> (makes me uncomfortable being near it, people who is drinking as well, and talking about it)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Drugs</b> (this makes me more uncomfortable than alcohol does, everything said in alcohol applies here too)

                Welcome to my Projects page, here I'll tell you a bit more about what I am currently working on, and some general information about it.

            <p>
                Currently I am doing a HTML, CSS, JS and Python Course, which I am enjoying. Never used these programming languages before, so I am happy to learn something new. This website is my first ever attempt at making a website with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

            <h3>
                Roblox
            </h3>
            <p>
                You may or may not know what Roblox is, so I'll quickly explain that first. Roblox is a platform online where you can play or create 'experiences' which others can play and experience. To make a game there requires learning LUAU, modeling, sound design and other things generally used in game design. You often work with others like friends or people you hire.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for some of my roblox projects, I'll give you a list with a slight explanation behind them.

                I also do character creation with the roblox system, which makes them look like square humans, but I have artists draw them later sometimes. Here are some characters I have made, and one which was drawn. (looking to at some point try to make characters in a more advanced program, for game design.)
